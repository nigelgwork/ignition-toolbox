## Summary

| Phase | Focus | Effort | Duration |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| 0 | Critical Updates | 20h | 1 week |
| 1 | Code Quality | 60h | 2-3 weeks |
| 2 | Testing | 80h | 3-4 weeks |
| 3 | Docs & UX | 40h | 2 weeks |
| 4 | Features | 120h | 4-6 weeks |

## Recommended Priority

1. **Phase 0** - Do immediately (Electron update is security-critical)
2. **Phase 1** - Start next (code quality enables everything else)
3. **Phase 2** - Essential for confidence in changes
4. **Phase 3** - Quick wins for user experience
5. **Phase 4-6** - Feature work based on user demand

---

## Notes

- Phases can overlap (e.g., start Phase 2 while finishing Phase 1)
- Effort estimates assume familiarity with codebase
- Each phase should end with a version release
- Consider hiring/contracting for Phase 6 if needed
