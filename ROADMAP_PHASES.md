## Recommended Priority

1. **Phase 0** - Do immediately (Electron update is security-critical)
2. **Phase 1** - Start next (code quality enables everything else)
3. **Phase 2** - Essential for confidence in changes
4. **Phase 3** - Quick wins for user experience
5. **Phase 4-6** - Feature work based on user demand

---

## Notes

- Phases can overlap (e.g., start Phase 2 while finishing Phase 1)
- Effort estimates assume familiarity with codebase
- Each phase should end with a version release
- Consider hiring/contracting for Phase 6 if needed
