## Problem Statement

Ignition SCADA acceptance testing currently suffers from four critical problems:

### 1. **Repeatability Problem**
Gateway operations (module upgrades, trial resets, project deployments, health checks) and Perspective UI testing are performed manually or with throwaway scripts. This leads to:
- Inconsistent test execution
- Human error in manual testing
- Lost knowledge when scripts aren't saved
- No standardized test procedures across teams

### 2. **Visual Verification Problem**
When testing Perspective web applications or Gateway operations, testers need to **SEE** what's happening to verify correctness:
- Blind script execution misses visual UI bugs
- No way to verify UX issues programmatically
- Can't pause and inspect state during execution
- No visual confirmation that operations succeeded

### 3. **Playbook Management Problem**
Test engineers need a library of reusable test patterns, not programming from scratch:
- Writing tests from scratch is time-consuming
- Similar tests (login flows, navigation, form validation) are rewritten repeatedly
- No easy way to duplicate and modify existing tests
- Difficult to share test procedures across teams

### 4. **AI-Assisted Testing Gap**
Some acceptance testing steps require intelligent decision-making that humans OR AI can perform:
- "Does this Perspective page look correct?" (visual regression)
- "Is the data displayed reasonable?" (intelligent assertions)
- "Why did this step fail?" (error analysis)
- Creating new tests from natural language descriptions

---

## Solution Overview

**Ignition Toolbox is a visual acceptance testing platform for Ignition SCADA with domain-separated playbook libraries, real-time visual feedback, and optional AI-assisted test creation and verification.**

### Core Capabilities

1. **Domain-Specific Playbook Libraries**
   - Gateway playbooks: REST API operations (upload modules, restart, health checks)
   - Perspective playbooks: Browser automation (UI testing with Playwright)
   - Designer playbooks (future): Designer automation (complex, non-web)

2. **Visual Real-Time Execution**
   - Step-by-step progress tracking
   - Live visual feedback (embedded browser for Perspective tests)
   - Pause/Resume/Skip controls during execution
   - Execution history and audit logs

3. **Modular Playbook Management**
   - Browse organized playbook library (categorized by domain)
   - Duplicate existing playbooks as starting point
   - Edit playbooks with AI assistance or manually
   - Import/Export for team collaboration
   - Secure credential management (Fernet encryption)

4. **AI-Injectable Intelligence**
   - AI-assisted playbook creation from natural language
   - AI-assisted playbook editing ("add a step to verify logout")
   - AI-injectable verification steps (visual regression, intelligent assertions)
   - Optional enhancement - playbooks work without AI

## Core Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Gateway Module Upgrade Acceptance Test
**Scenario:** Test that a new Gateway module can be uploaded and activated successfully

**Playbook Type:** Gateway (domain-specific)

**Steps:**
1. Login to Gateway
2. Upload .modl file
3. Verify module appears in module list
4. Restart Gateway
5. Wait for Gateway to be ready
6. Verify module is in "running" state

**Visual Feedback:** Progress indicators, API response previews

**Reusability:** Duplicate and change module file parameter for different modules

---

### Use Case 2: Perspective Login Flow Acceptance Test
**Scenario:** Test that users can log into a Perspective application and navigate to dashboard

**Playbook Type:** Perspective (domain-specific)

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Perspective session URL
2. Fill username field
3. Fill password field
4. Click login button
5. Verify dashboard page loads
6. Verify user widget shows correct username
7. Take screenshot for visual regression

**Visual Feedback:** Embedded browser showing live Perspective session (user SEES login happening)

**Reusability:** Duplicate and modify selectors for different Perspective projects

---

### Use Case 3: Perspective Form Validation Test
**Scenario:** Test that form validation works correctly on a Perspective page

**Playbook Type:** Perspective (domain-specific)

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to form page
2. Click submit button (without filling fields)
3. Verify error messages appear
4. Fill required fields
5. Click submit button
6. Verify success message or navigation
7. AI-injectable step: "Does this form look correct?" (visual verification)

**Visual Feedback:** Embedded browser showing form interactions

**Reusability:** Duplicate and modify for different forms

---

### Use Case 4: AI-Assisted Test Creation
**Scenario:** Test engineer needs to create a new test but doesn't want to write YAML from scratch

**Workflow:**
1. Describe test in natural language: "Create a test that verifies the dashboard chart loads and shows production data"
2. AI generates playbook with appropriate steps
3. Review generated playbook
4. Execute with visual feedback to verify
5. Refine if needed (AI-assisted editing: "also verify the legend appears")
6. Save to library

**Visual Feedback:** Embedded browser showing chart rendering

**Reusability:** Generated playbook becomes template for similar tests

---

### Use Case 5: Sequential Test Execution (Domain Separation in Practice)
**Scenario:** Test end-to-end deployment and functionality

**Workflow:**
1. Run "upload_project.yml" (Gateway playbook) - Upload new Perspective project
2. Wait for completion
3. Run "test_dashboard.yml" (Perspective playbook) - Verify new dashboard works
4. Review combined execution history

**Note:** These are TWO separate playbooks, run sequentially - NOT one playbook mixing Gateway and Perspective steps

**Why Separate:** Clearer organization, easier troubleshooting, reusable components

## Key Principles

These principles guide ALL feature decisions and implementation work:

### Principle 1: **Domain Separation**

**Playbooks stay domain-specific: Gateway OR Perspective OR Designer (never mixed)**

**Rationale:**
- Simpler execution model
- Clearer organization and troubleshooting
- Easier to maintain and share
- Reduces complexity

**Implementation:**
```
playbooks/
├── gateway/              # Gateway-only playbooks
│   ├── reset_trial.yml
│   ├── upload_module.yml
│   └── backup.yml
├── perspective/          # Perspective-only playbooks
│   ├── test_login.yml
│   ├── test_dashboard.yml
│   └── test_forms.yml
└── designer/             # Designer-only playbooks (future)
    └── (TBD)
```

**Anti-Pattern (DO NOT DO):**
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - mixing domains in one playbook
steps:
  - type: gateway.restart       # Gateway domain
  - type: perspective.navigate  # Perspective domain (different domain!)
```

**Correct Pattern:**
```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Run playbooks sequentially if needed

# Playbook 1: gateway_deploy.yml (Gateway domain only)
steps:
  - type: gateway.upload_project
  - type: gateway.restart

# Playbook 2: perspective_verify.yml (Perspective domain only)
steps:
  - type: perspective.navigate
  - type: perspective.verify_element
```

Users execute: `gateway_deploy.yml` → wait for completion → `perspective_verify.yml`

---

### Principle 2: **Visual Feedback is Required, Not Optional**

**Users must SEE what's happening during test execution, especially for Perspective tests**

**Rationale:**
- Acceptance testing requires visual verification
- Blind execution misses UX issues
- Real-time feedback enables pause-and-inspect workflow
- Builds confidence in test results

**Implementation:**
- Perspective tests: Embedded Playwright browser showing live session
- Gateway tests: Visual progress indicators and API response previews
- All tests: Step-by-step progress with real-time status updates

**Current State:**
- ✅ Step progress tracking (done)
- ✅ Embedded browser view (done, v1.0.4)

---

### Principle 3: **Modular Playbook Library Over Programming**

**Users duplicate and modify existing playbooks - they don't write from scratch**

**Rationale:**
- Test engineers need patterns, not programming
- Duplicating is faster than creating from scratch
- Encourages standardization and best practices
- Lowers barrier to entry

**User Workflow:**
1. Browse playbook library
2. Find similar test
3. Click "Duplicate"
4. Modify copy for specific needs
5. Execute and verify
6. Save to library

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Easy-to-browse playbook library ✅ (done)
- One-click duplication ✅ (done, v1.4.66)
- YAML editor with AI assistance ✅ (done, v1.4.68)
- Form-based editor for non-technical users ✅ (done, v1.4.75)

---

### Principle 4: **AI is Injectable and Optional**

**AI assists where helpful but is never required for playbook execution**

**Rationale:**
- AI speeds up test creation and editing
- AI enables intelligent verification
- But not all users have AI access
- Core functionality must work without AI

**AI Integration Points:**
1. **Playbook Creation:** "Create a test that verifies login flow" → generates playbook
2. **Playbook Editing:** "Add a step to verify logout button" → modifies playbook
3. **Verification Steps:** `perspective.verify_with_ai` uses AI for visual regression
4. **Error Analysis:** AI suggests fixes when steps fail

**Implementation:**
- AI module with Claude integration ✅ (done)
- AI chat interface ✅ (done, v1.0.26)
- AI-injectable steps ✅ (done, v1.4.75)

---

### Principle 5: **Secure by Default**

**Credentials never appear in playbooks, always encrypted at rest**

**Rationale:**
- Playbooks must be shareable without exposing secrets
- Compliance requirements (audit trail without passwords)
- Security best practice

**Implementation:**
- Fernet-encrypted credential vault ✅
- Credential references in playbooks (`{{ credential.gateway_admin }}`) ✅
- Export strips credentials, includes only references ✅
- UI credential management ✅

---

## What This Is NOT

Understanding boundaries helps evaluate feature requests:

### ❌ NOT a Replacement for Ignition's Built-In Scripting

**If you need:**
- Real-time Gateway event handling
- Tag change scripts
- Message handlers
- Alarm pipeline notifications

**Use:** Ignition's built-in scripting (Python/Jython in Gateway)

**This tool is for:** Administrative operations and acceptance testing, not runtime logic

---

### ❌ NOT a General-Purpose Automation Framework

**If you need:**
- AWS/Azure/GCP automation
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Generic infrastructure management

**Use:** Ansible, Terraform, or cloud-native tools

**This tool is for:** Ignition-specific acceptance testing (Gateway, Perspective, Designer)

---

### ❌ NOT a Designer Replacement

**If you need:**
- Create or modify Perspective views
- Edit Vision windows
- Configure UDTs or tags
- Design HMI screens

**Use:** Ignition Designer

**This tool is for:** Testing Designer projects, not creating them

---

### ❌ NOT a Monitoring/Alerting System

**If you need:**
- 24/7 health monitoring
- Alert notifications
- Performance dashboards
- Uptime tracking

**Use:** Nagios, Grafana, Prometheus, or Ignition's built-in alarming

**This tool is for:** On-demand acceptance testing, not continuous monitoring

---

### ❌ NOT Headless-Only Testing

**If you think:**
- "Visual feedback is optional"
- "Headless execution is faster"
- "I just need API testing"

**Understand:** Visual verification is a CORE REQUIREMENT for Perspective acceptance testing. Headless mode may be added as an option later, but visual mode is primary.

---

## Decision-Making Framework

Use these questions to evaluate ANY feature request, bug fix, or design decision:

### Question 1: Does this help users manage playbooks (create/edit/duplicate/organize)?
- **YES** → High priority (core value proposition)
- **NO** → Consider other questions

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Add playbook duplication button" → YES (high priority)
- ✅ "Add YAML editor" → YES (high priority)
- ❌ "Add Gateway tag browsing" → NO (not playbook management)

---

### Question 2: Does this maintain domain separation (Gateway OR Perspective OR Designer, not mixed)?
- **YES** → Consider it
- **NO** → REJECT IT (violates core principle)

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Add more Gateway step types" → YES (stays in Gateway domain)
- ✅ "Add Perspective form validation steps" → YES (stays in Perspective domain)
- ❌ "Allow calling Perspective steps from Gateway playbooks" → NO (mixes domains)

---

### Question 3: Does this provide or enhance visual feedback during execution?
- **YES** → High priority (core requirement)
- **NO** → Still valid if it's non-visual domain (pure Gateway API)

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Add embedded browser view for Perspective tests" → YES (critical feature)
- ✅ "Add screenshot comparison" → YES (visual regression)
- ✅ "Add Gateway health check step" → Still valid (non-visual but useful)

---

### Question 4: Does this support optional AI assistance?
- **YES** → Consider it (valuable enhancement)
- **NO** → Still valid if manual operation is sufficient

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Add AI chat for playbook creation" → YES (speeds up workflow)
- ✅ "Add AI visual regression step" → YES (intelligent verification)
- ✅ "Add manual YAML editor" → Still valid (AI is optional)

---

### Question 5: Does this keep playbooks reusable and shareable?
- **YES** → Consider it
- **NO** → Might still be valid for one-off operations

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Improve import/export" → YES (team collaboration)
- ✅ "Add playbook templates" → YES (starting points)
- ❌ "Add hardcoded Gateway URLs in playbooks" → NO (not reusable)

---

### Decision Matrix Examples

#### Example 1: "Should we add drag-and-drop for playbook import?"
- Q1 (Playbook management): **YES** - Makes import easier
- Q2 (Domain separation): **N/A** - Doesn't affect domain model

- Q2 (Domain separation): **NO** - Violates domain separation principle
- Q3 (Visual feedback): **N/A**
- Q4 (AI assistance): **N/A**
- Q5 (Reusability): **NO** - Makes playbooks more complex

**DECISION:** ❌ REJECT - Violates core principle (domain separation)

**Alternative:** Run two playbooks sequentially (Gateway playbook → Perspective playbook)

---

#### Example 3: "Should we add embedded browser view for Perspective tests?"
- Q1 (Playbook management): **YES** - Helps verify tests work correctly
- Q2 (Domain separation): **YES** - Perspective-specific feature
- Q3 (Visual feedback): **YES** - Core requirement for acceptance testing
- Q4 (AI assistance): **NO** - Manual visual verification
- Q5 (Reusability): **YES** - Confirms playbooks work as expected

**DECISION:** ✅ STRONGLY ACCEPT - Aligns with all criteria, CRITICAL FEATURE

---

#### Example 4: "Should we add Ansible integration?"
- Q1 (Playbook management): **NO** - Different kind of playbook
- Q2 (Domain separation): **NO** - Outside Ignition domains
- Q3 (Visual feedback): **NO** - No visual execution
- Q4 (AI assistance): **NO**
- Q5 (Reusability): **MAYBE** - But Ansible has its own reusability

**DECISION:** ❌ REJECT - Out of scope, use Ansible directly if needed
