"""
Cancellation utilities for playbook execution

Provides reusable utilities for implementing responsive cancellation
in all step types. All long-running operations should use these utilities
to ensure consistent cancellation behavior.

    Sleep that respects cancellation signals

    Instead of sleeping for the full duration, sleeps in small intervals.
    When task.cancel() is called, asyncio.sleep() will automatically raise
    CancelledError at the next interval, ensuring cancellation is detected
    within check_interval seconds.

        seconds: Total time to sleep in seconds

        asyncio.CancelledError: If task is cancelled during sleep

    Example:

    Poll a condition with cancellation support

    Checks a condition repeatedly until it returns True or timeout is reached.

    Mixin to add cancellation checking to executors

    CancelledError at await points when task.cancel() is called.
